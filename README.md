# Objection Godot *(name pending)*

>[!WARNING]
> This is a work in progress, and is currently not suitable for general use.

This project reads an XML-like file (currently with a hard-coded name, but will be changed in the future) and plays it out as an *Ace Attorney* scene without any user input, then exits automatically.
For script examples, see the `test_*.xml` files.

This project currently uses Godot 4.3.

## Roadmap

See the [issues page](https://github.com/Meorge/objection-godot/issues) for planned features and fixes.

## Credits

Obviously, this project as a whole is based on the *Ace Attorney* games, especially the versions for the Nintendo DS.

This project is a continuation of the [Objection! rendering engine](https://github.com/LuisMayo/objection_engine), maintained by [LuisMayo](https://github.com/LuisMayo).

Many of the assets (including character animations and UI elements) were ripped by contributors to the [Court Records website](https://www.court-records.net).

TODO: Get proper citations for

(Obviously, there's *Ace Attorney* assets in here, so take that into consideration if you're gonna do stuff with it)
