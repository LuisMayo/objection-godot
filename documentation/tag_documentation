# Tag Documentation

## Tags

### General control

```xml
<play />
```

Starts the current queued text and commands.

Once this tag is reached, the text will clear, so it's best to put a `<wait>` tag immediately before it so the viewer has time to read the text.

```xml
<wait secs="float" />
```

Pauses movement through the script for a given number of `secs`.

```xml
<speed val="default|float" />
```

Sets the speed for the text display to `val`.

To reset it to the default speed, pass `val="default"`.

### Name tag and text box

```xml
<nametag text="string" />
```

Sets the nametag to display the given string `text`. If `text` is an empty string, then the nametag will be hidden.

```xml
<box set="in|out" />
```

Makes the text box instantaneously appear if `set="in"`, or disappear if `set="out"`.

```xml
<box anim="in|out" />
```

Slides the text box onto the screen if `anim="in"`, or off-screen if `anim="out"`.

```xml
<arrow action="show|hide" />
```

Shows or hides the "next dialogue" arrow at the bottom-right corner of the text box.
If no `action` is provided, it defaults to showing the arrow.

Note that the arrow is not a child of the text box.
That means that if the text box is hidden, such as with `<box set="out" />`, and the arrow is shown with `<arrow action="show" />`, the arrow will appear above the scene.

### Text color

```xml
<color value="string"></color>
```

Sets the color of the enclosed text to `value`.

### Visual effects

```xml
<flash duration="float:0.15" />
```

Turns the screen white for `duration` seconds.

```xml
<shake magnitude="float:5.0" duration="float:0.3" />
```

Shakes the screen with a given `magnitude` for `duration` seconds.

```xml
<confetti action="start" count="float:31" />
```

Starts playing the confetti animation, with `count` flakes of confetti.

```xml
<confetti action="stop" />
```

Stops the confetti animation and immediately deletes all on-screen confetti.

### Sprites

```xml
<sprite pos="string" res="path" anim="string" />
```

Changes the animated sprite for the given `pos`, to use the animation named `anim` within the `SpriteFrames` asset at the path `res`.

The current built-in locations are:

- `left` - The left side of the courtroom, where the defense attorney stands.
- `center` - The witness stand.
- `right` - The right side of the courtroom, where the prosecutor stands.

### Music and sound effects

> [!WARNING]
> Loading WAV audio files from outside of Objection-Godot is currently broken.
> Until it gets fixed, it's best to use MP3 or OGG files instead.

```xml
<music action="play|stop" res="path" />
```

Performs a music-related `action`.

- If `action="play"`, then the music file at the path given by `res` will start playing.

- If `action="stop"`, then the currently playing music will be stopped.

```xml
<sound res="path" />
```

Plays the sound effect at the path given by `res` once.

```xml
<blip type="male|female|typewriter|none" />
```

Sets the speaking blip sound effect to `type`.

- `type="male"` and `type="female"` are used for male and female characters, respectively.

- `type="typewriter"` is used for scene introductions, such as at the start of a trial or investigation segment.

- `type="none"` disables the sounds completely.

### Camera

```xml
<cut to="location" />
```

Immediately snaps the camera to the location given by `to`.

```xml
<pan to="location" />
```

Moves the camera to the location given by `to` over a short period of time.

This is intended to be used when the initial and final positions of the camera are within the courtroom "wide shot" (that is, they are both `left`, `center`, or `right`).

### "Witness Testimony" title text

```xml
<bigtext top="string" bottom="string" color="string" dir="lr|ud" />
```

Displays a "Witness Testimony" animation in large block letters.
The text is always made of two lines.
The string for `top` is displayed as the top line, and the string for `bottom` is displayed as the bottom line.
The fill color of the text is defined by `color`.

The `dir` argument dictates how the two lines of text should animate out.

- If `dir="lr"`, the top line will move right, and the bottom line will move left.

- If `dir="ud"`, the top line will move up, and the bottom line will move down.

### Evidence

```xml
<evidence side="left|right" action="show|hide|hide_immediate" res="location" />
```

Updates the evidence/object boxes on the left or right side of the screen.

The `side` argument must be either `"left"` or `"right"`, and indicates which evidence box should receive the command.

The `action` argument states what action the evidence box should perform.

- If `action="show"`, then the `res` argument must be a path to the image to display in the box.
The box will animate on-screen, and display the image.

- If `action="hide"`, then the box will animate off-screen.

- If `action="hide_immediate"`, then the box will immediately disappear, without any animation.

### New evidence

```xml
<new_evidence slide="in|out|auto:auto" title="string" description="string" res="" />
```

Animates the "new evidence" box in or out.

If `slide` is `in` (or it is `auto` and the box is currently out), the box will slide in while playing the corresponding jingle.
The evidence title, description, and thumbnail texture can be set with the `title`, `description`, and `res` arguments respectively.

If `slide` is `out` (or it is `auto` and the box is currently in), the box will slide out of view while playing the corresponding sound effect.



### Exclamation bubbles

```xml
<bubble type="objection|holdit|takethat" />
```

Animates an exclamation bubble given by `type`.

Note that no sound is played automatically.
To play a character's voice clip along with the bubble, use a `<sound>` tag at the same time.

### Gavel slam

```xml
<gavel num="int:3" between="float:0.17" after="float:0.766" />
```

Animates the Judge's gavel slam `num` times in a row.

The argument `between` gives the delay between slams, if more than one slam is performed.

The argument `after` gives the delay after the last slam before script execution continues.

### Wide shot

> [!NOTE]
> This refers to the view of the courtroom where the lawyers, witness, judge, and gallery are all visible at once.

```xml
<wide pos="prosecution|defense|witness|judge" res="location" />
```

Sets the character at `pos` in the wide shot to use the texture at `res`.

```xml
<wide.gallery set="in|out" animate="true|false" />
```

If the argument `set` is provided, makes the gallery visible or invisible.

If the argument `animate` is provided, sets whether or not the gallery should animate.

### Verdict

```xml
<verdict text="string" group_by="word|letter:letter" font_color="color:white" font_outline_color="color:black" />
```

Displays the provided `text` on-screen as if it were the Judge's verdict, with a dramatic animation and sound effects.

If `group_by="word"`, then each word in the `text` (i.e., groups of non-space characters) will animate together.
If `group_by="letter"`, each letter/character in the `text` will animate in sequence.

The `font_color` and `font_outline_color` arguments set the color of the text and its outline, respectively.

### Flashing segment label

```xml
<segment_title text="string:" font_color="color:white" font_outline_color="color:aa-flashtestimony" time_in="float:1.433" time_out="float:0.34" />
```

Displays a flashing label in the top-left corner of the screen with the provided `text`.
The label's font has the body color given by `font_color` and the outline color given by `font_outline_color`.
It will appear for `time_in` seconds, and then disappear for `time_out` seconds.

If no `text` is provided (or `text` is an empty string) then the title will be invisible.

Defaults for the other arguments replicate the look and timing of the "Testimony" flashing label in the *Ace Attorney* DS games.

### Static color background

```xml
<bg set="in|out|auto:auto" color="color?" />
<bg fade="in|out|auto:auto" duration="float:0.5" color="color?" />
```

Sets or fades the background to a solid color.

Either the `set` or the `fade` argument should be used (not both).

If the `set` argument is used, the solid background will appear or disappear instantly.
If the `fade` argument is used, the background will fade into or out of view over the given `duration`.

If the value of `set` or `fade` is `auto`, then the background will switch to the opposite state.

### "Perceive" background from *Apollo Justice*

```xml
<perceive set="in|out|auto:auto" />
<perceive fade="in|out|auto:auto" duration="float:0.5" />
```

Displays the animated "Perceive" visual behind the characters from *Apollo Justice*.

Either the `set` or the `fade` argument should be used (not both).

If the `set` argument is used, the visual will appear or disappear instantly.
If the `fade` argument is used, the visual will fade into or out of view over the given `duration`.

If the value of `set` or `fade` is `auto`, then the visual will toggle its state away from the current state (that is, if it is currently visible, it will become invisible, and vice versa).

## Data types

### `color`

Colors can be an HTML color code (like `#385A8B`) or a case-insensitive named color.
(Internally, [the Godot `Color.from_string` method](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_color.html#class-color-method-from-string) is used, so check that for more information.)

In addition, there are a few case-*sensitive* colors provided to match the *Ace Attorney* games:

- `aa-text-red` is the text color used to highlight important words and phrases.
- `aa-text-blue` is the text color used for characters' inner thoughts.
- `aa-text-green` is the text color used for phone calls and other "indirect" communications.
- `aa-witintro-red` is the text color used for the "Cross Examination" title that appears before cross-examining a witness.
- `aa-witintro-blue` is the text color used for the "Witness Testimony" title that appears before hearing testimony.
